    <p>Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas. 
        Black tea is generally stronger in flavor than other teas. All four types are made from leaves of the shrub
        (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Two principal
        varieties of the species are used the small-leaved Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis var. sinensis),
         used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved
         Assamese plant (C. sinensis var. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, 
        \although in recent years some green and white teas have been produced. In China, where black tea was developed,
        [1] the beverage is called "red tea", due to the color of the oxidized leaves when processed appropriately.[1]
    </p><p style="margin-top: 40px;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea"
     target="_blank" title="green tea specification">green tea</a> usually loses its flavor within a year, black tea retains 
        its flavor for several years. For this reason, it has long been an article of trade, and compressed
         bricks of black tea even served as a form of de facto currency in Mongolia,
        Tibet and Siberia into the 19th century.[2]
    Black tea is usually graded on one of four scales of quality. Whole-leaf teas are the highest quality,
     with the best whole-leaf teas graded as "orange pekoe." After the whole-leaf teas, the scale degrades
      to broken leaves, fannings, then dusts. Whole-leaf teas are produced
     with little or no alteration to the tea leaf. This results in a finished product with a 
     texture than that of bagged teas. Whole-leaf teas are widely considered the most valuable, especially
     if they contain leaf tips. Broken leaves are commonly sold as medium-grade loose teas.
    </p><p style="margin-top: 40px;">Smaller broken varieties may be included in tea bags. 
        Fannings are usually small particles of tea left over from the production of larger tea varieties,
        but are occasionally manufactured specifically for use in bagged teas. Dusts are the finest particles
         of tea left over from production 
         of the above varieties, and are often used for tea bags with very fast and harsh brews.
         Fannings and dusts are useful in bagged teas because the greater surface area of the many particles
         allows for a fast, complete diffusion of the tea into the water. Fannings and dusts usually 
        have a darker colour, lack of sweetness, and stronger flavor when brewed.</p>
